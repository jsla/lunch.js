# lunch.js

Lunch.js is a monthly neighborhood centric lunch time community meetup. It takes place in all of LA's neighbourhoods, every first Tuesday of the month at 12:30pm.

It's an opportunity to

- Meet other developers that work in your part of town
- Find a mentor to help level up your carrer
- Find a mentee to drop some knowledge on
- Pick the brain of a Sr. Developer
- Have heated discussions about which framework is better (actually, please don't do this)

## How to join a lunch.js event

Every lunch.js event is organized using an issue in this repository ([example](https://github.com/jsla/lunch.js/issues/258)). Open an issue for one of the upcoming events above and comment on it to let the champion of the event know that you will be coming.

## How to create a lunch.js event

**Note:** Due to COVID, we are currently not looking for new champions. For the time being, we are hosting an online version. But please stay tuned! Watch this repository to get notified once we start in-person events again.

~~If there is no lunch.js in your neighbourhood yet, become a champion and create one yourself! [Create an issue](https://github.com/jsla/lunch.js/issues/new) and learn [what it means to be a champion](https://github.com/jsla/lunch.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#readme)).~~
