# lunch.js

Lunch.js is a monthly neighborhood centric lunch time community meetup. It takes place in all of LA's neighbourhoods, every first Tuesday of the month at 12:30pm.

It's an opportunity to

- Meet other developers that work in your part of town
- Find a mentor to help level up your carrer
- Find a mentee to drop some knowledge on
- Pick the brain of a Sr. Developer
- Have heated discussions about which framework is better (actually, please don't do this)

## How to join a lunch.js event

Every lunch.js event is organized using an issue in this repository ([example](https://github.com/jsla/lunch.js/issues/258)). Open an issue for one of the upcoming events above and comment on it to let the champion of the event know that you will be coming.

## How to create a lunch.js event

If there is no lunch.js in your neighbourhood yet, become a champion and create one yourself! [Create an issue](https://github.com/jsla/lunch.js/issues/new) and learn [what it means to be a champion](https://github.com/jsla/lunch.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#readme)).
