As the champion you can pick a place,
  or be really cool and make a poll!
  Use reaction emojis as votes,
  include Yelp links, or don't, whatever.
If convenient, let others know how to
  identify you at lunch, so new Lunchers
  won't feel lost!  (E.g., "I'll be the
  one with purple hair and red glasses")
