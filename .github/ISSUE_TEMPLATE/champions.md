Hey Everyone,

The next first Tuesday of the month is ${date}
Please create new issues when you get the chance.

Note that Lunch.js runs much smoother when each location has two champions. Feel free to share champion duties with another member of your lunch location!

Previous Lunch Locations
Santa Monica
Baldwin Hills / Crenshaw / Leimert Park
Atwater Village / Eagle Rock


pinging previous champions...
@powernerd @StevenKitzes @gr2m @davidguttman @jarrettch @jcblw @JakeDluhy @jjandoc @swatana3 @ultamatt

If anyone is unable to champion let me know or reach out to those that have attended your location to see if someone wants to step in. Comment on this thread if you need me to remove you from the above list of previous champions.

If you want to start a new neighborhood Lunch.js check out the champion guide and comment here to get started!
