# Lunch.js Maintenance Guide ⚙️👩🏻‍🔧️👨🏾‍🔧️🛠️

We are currently in the process to asses how to automate some the task that the maintainers currently have to do manually.

- [ ] Make sure the issues have the correct labels set: `lunch.js event`, `location set`, `needs location`,`BYOL`
- [ ] Make sure each event has a location set a few days before the event
- [ ] Shortly before the event, make sure the host uploaded a picture or explained how to find them
- [ ] After the event was concluded
  - [ ] close the issue
  - [ ] check in with the champion about the list of attendees and a group picture
  - [ ] Create a "Calling all champions!" issue ([example](https://github.com/jsla/lunch.js/issues/260)) after a lunch.js was concluded.

## Automated

- [x] [#280](https://github.com/jsla/lunch.js/pull/280) Keep the list of upcoming events in the [README.md](README.md) up to date
